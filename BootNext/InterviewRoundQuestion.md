1. Immutability, in java what are the immutable classes in java 

Ans:-
2. Equal & HashCode contract   => Whether it is mandatory to add the same fields in hashcode methods while overriding hashcode() and equal() that you have added in the equals method 

Ans:-Equal & HashCode contract - Yes, when overriding both equals() and hashCode() methods, it is essential to include the same fields in both methods. If two objects are equal according to equals(), their hash codes must be the same. This ensures consistency and correctness when using objects as keys in hash-based collections.

3. How can you generate HashCode in Java 

Ans:-Generating HashCode in Java - The hashCode() method can be generated using IDEs like IntelliJ or Eclipse, which provide an automated way to generate hash codes based on the fields of the class. Manually, you can follow techniques like using prime numbers and combining the hash codes of individual fields to generate a hash code for the entire object.

4. What is the importance of prime numbers in generating hashCodes

Ans:-Importance of prime numbers in generating hash codes - Using prime numbers in generating hash codes helps in reducing the likelihood of collisions (two different objects having the same hash code) and distributes the objects more evenly across the hash table, improving the performance of hash-based collections.

 5. How can you configure your spring boot application to give a response in the form of XML

Ans:-Configuring Spring Boot Application to give a response in the form of XML - To configure a Spring Boot application to produce XML responses, you can include the Jackson XML dependency in your project, and Spring Boot will automatically use the appropriate message converter to handle XML serialization.

6. How will you create a daemon thread in java ?

Ans:-Creating a daemon thread in Java - In Java, you can create a daemon thread using the setDaemon(true) method on the Thread object. Daemon threads are used to perform background tasks and are automatically terminated when all non-daemon threads have finished.

7. If REST is stateless why in definition it says state transfer protocol

Ans:-Asynchronous REST API - To make a REST API asynchronous, you can use techniques like asynchronous processing using CompletableFuture, Reactive programming using Spring WebFlux, or using async servlets in Java Servlets to handle concurrent requests more efficiently.

 8. Idempotent nature of APi's in Case of PATCH,PUT,POST,GET

Ans:-Idempotent nature of APIs in Case of PATCH, PUT, POST, GET:
- GET: GET requests are idempotent because multiple identical GET requests will produce the same response, and they have no side effects on the server.
- PUT: PUT requests are idempotent because multiple identical PUT requests will have the same effect as a single request, resulting in the same state on the server.
- POST: POST requests are not idempotent because multiple identical POST requests may result in different resources being created on the server.
- PATCH: PATCH requests are intended to be idempotent, but it depends on the implementation. If a PATCH request modifies the resource incrementally, multiple identical PATCH requests will produce the same state.

9. How can you make an REST API Asynchronous in your application

Ans:-How can you make a REST API Asynchronous in your application:
To make a REST API asynchronous, you can use techniques like CompletableFuture, Reactive programming with Spring WebFlux, or async servlets in Java Servlets. Asynchronous APIs can handle concurrent requests more efficiently and improve the application's overall responsiveness.

10. What is the importance of prime numbers in generating hashCodes?

Ans:-Importance of prime numbers in generating hashCodes:
Using prime numbers in generating hash codes helps in reducing the likelihood of collisions (two different objects having the same hash code) and distributes the objects more evenly across the hash table, improving the performance of hash-based collections.

11. How can you configure your spring boot application to give responses in the form of XML ?

Ans:-Configuring Spring Boot Application to give responses in the form of XML:
To configure a Spring Boot application to produce XML responses, you need to include the Jackson XML dependency in your project. Spring Boot will automatically use the appropriate message converter to handle XML serialization and deserialization.

12. How will you create a daemon thread in java if REST is stateless why in definition it says state transfer protocol ?

Ans:-Creating a daemon thread in Java - If REST is stateless, why in definition, it says state transfer protocol?

Creating a daemon thread in Java involves setting the thread as a daemon using the setDaemon(true) method. Daemon threads are used for background tasks and are automatically terminated when all non-daemon threads have finished.
-  The term "state transfer protocol" in the definition of REST refers to the fact that RESTful applications transfer the state (representations of resources) between the client and the server during interactions, but the server doesn't retain any information about the client's state between requests.

13. How can you make an API Asynchronous?

Ans:-How can you make a REST API Asynchronous in your application:
To make a REST API asynchronous, you can use techniques like CompletableFuture, Reactive programming with Spring WebFlux, or async servlets in Java Servlets. Asynchronous APIs can handle concurrent requests more efficiently and improve the application's overall responsiveness.

- Abstraction: Abstraction is a fundamental OOP concept that hides the implementation details of an object and exposes only the essential features or behavior to the outside world.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is another OOP principle that bundles the data and methods operating on that data into a single unit, preventing direct access to the data from outside the class.
- Overloading and Overriding: Overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. Overriding involves providing a specific implementation for a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass.
- Singleton class Implementation: Singleton is a design pattern where a class can have only one instance throughout the application's lifecycle.
- HTTP Methods Detailed: HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are used to perform various operations on resources in a RESTful API.
- Disadvantages of REST APIs: Some disadvantages include lack of standardized error handling, potential security vulnerabilities, and tight coupling between client and server.
- Can we override the main method: Yes, the main method in Java can be overridden, but it's not recommended because it is the entry point of a Java program, and changing its signature may lead to problems.
- @Autowired: It is used for automatic dependency injection in Spring to wire beans together.
- Spring IOC concept: Inversion of Control (IOC) in Spring refers to the Spring container's control over the creation and management of objects (beans).
- RestController and Controller Difference: @RestController is used to define RESTful APIs and return data in the response body directly, while @Controller is used for MVC applications and typically returns view templates.
