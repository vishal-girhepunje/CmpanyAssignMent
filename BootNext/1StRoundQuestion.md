 - Spring Beans: Spring beans are the objects that are managed by the Spring container. They are typically Java objects that are initialized, configured, and managed by Spring.

 - OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming): It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which encapsulate data and behavior together. OOPs principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

 - Singleton Class: It is a design pattern where a class is instantiated only once, and all subsequent requests for new instances return a reference to the same instance.

 - Exceptions: Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. In Java, exceptions are managed using try-catch blocks.

30.Abstraction

Ans:-Abstraction:

36.What is the hashCode () and equals () used for?

Ans:-What is the hashCode() and equals() used for?
- In Java, hashCode() and equals() are methods from the Object class, which is the root class for all Java objects. These methods are essential when dealing with collections like HashMap, HashSet, and others that rely on hash-based data structures.

- hashCode(): The hashCode() method returns an integer value representing the hash code of an object. It is used by hash-based collections to efficiently store and retrieve objects. When you override the equals() method, you should also override hashCode() to ensure that two objects that are equal according to equals() have the same hash code.

- equals(): The equals() method compares two objects for equality. By default, it checks if two objects are the same instance (i.e., their references point to the same memory location). However, for many classes, you need to override equals() to define what equality means for instances of that class based on their attributes.

- It's important to maintain the contract between hashCode() and equals(), which states that if two objects are equal according to equals(), their hash codes must be the same. Otherwise, collections may behave unexpectedly.

37.What is @autowired used for?
         a. https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Ans:-What is @Autowired used for?
@Autowired is an annotation in Spring Framework used for automatic dependency injection. When you annotate a field, setter method, or constructor with @Autowired, Spring will automatically inject the dependent bean (a component or service) into that field or method during the application's context initialization. It helps in reducing the manual wiring of dependencies and promotes loose coupling between components.
